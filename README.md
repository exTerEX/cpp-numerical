Numerical methods in modern C++

## Content

A brief description and summary of different methods implemented in this repository.

### Bisection

The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow.

### Derivative



### False position



### Forward Euler



### Newton-Raphson
